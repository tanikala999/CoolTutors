# School and Gym CRM
An MVC servlet that provides an interface for schools or gyms to host teachers or coaches and allows students to sign up for classes

It is written in Java, Freemarker, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, and designed to be hosted on a Tomcat-9 engine.

### "Elevator Pitch"
Let's say you're a gym.
Or let's say you're a school.
Or let's say you're just a stay-at-home parent trying to part-time tutor but have trouble keeping track of everybody and their classes.

We've got you covered! For the low low price of free you can have your very own all-in-one, custom-built Customer Resources Manager (CRM) system that allows you to easily manage ever-increasing scales of students and teachers or coaches, and what's the catch? There is none. It works well, it's super easy to use, and the feedback from all our clients is that they are absolutely enchanted by it.
